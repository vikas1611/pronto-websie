        <h3>Agile Methology</h3>
        <p>Agile is the leading methodology in providing better outcomes to the web solutions. Agile methodology breaks down larger projects into small, manageable chunks and we at pronto makes sure to follow the same methodology for all our products. This methodology is not only awesome in terms of outcome of the product but also helps the client to monitor the work time to time. Unlike the traditional waterfall projects, it makes it easy to prioritize and add or drop features mid project. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Agile methodology tends to make the project more flexible and cost control. This way of proceeding offers transparency and trust amongst our valuable clients. Starting from planning, execution, review and ultimately repeat, we do it all as per the methodology. The projects are broken down into small and consistent time intervals which tend to make the outcomes more productive. Agile has come up to be the best process to manage projects and and software developments and we make it our priority to be agile in both our work and the outcomes.
